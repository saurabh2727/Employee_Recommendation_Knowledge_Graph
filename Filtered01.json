            "Experience": "Feb \u201917 \u2013 Present I am currently enhancing my web development skills in JavaScript and Node.js to develop apps for emerging blockchain technologies. I am also developing my as incorporating decentralized file storage options via the Sia blockchain. I have built up my blockchain knowledge and skill sets through YouTube tutorials, Udemy courses, reading books, listening to podcasts and experimenting with app development. International Telecommunications Satellite Organization Jul \u201916 \u2013 Oct\u201916 The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO), formerly known as Intelsat, is the intergovernmental body tasked with ensuring the 149 member states have access to satellite communications on a global and non- discriminatory basis. My principal roles have been to conduct research on the importance of satellite communications and help facilitate the Assembly of Parties summit, where a new Director General was appointed. Using my postgraduate research skills, I have explored how satellite technology can aid in the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well how the Arab region can deploy satellite technologies to further economic and social development. Assisting with the summit preparations, I have been responsible for reviewing documentation for the delegates, liaising with embassy and ministry officials, and collaborating with colleagues to determine logistics for the event. Queensland Audit Office Feb \u201915 \u2013 Jun \u201915 As a data analyst with the Queensland Audit Office, I have used my SQL and QlikView skills to develop interactive dashboards, providing insights into state and local government departments. In addition, I have developed my Ernst & Young During my time at Talkup Communications, one of my main engagements was Feb \u201913 \u2013 Feb \u201815 to research, evaluate, select and implement an email marketing system. I As a consultant with Ernst & Young, I have acquired and strengthened my business intelligence and auditing skills. I have worked on business intelligence projects for airlines, banks and government departments. Using my SQL, QlikView and SAS knowledge, I have assisted in determining the efficacy of a doctor remuneration scheme, provided insights into patient outcomes in the state healthcare system and provided data analytics on transaction data assurance. As an auditor, I have reviewed the change management, user access and asset management processes of banks, government agencies and private sector corporations. As part of the fieldwork of these engagements, I assessed policies, interviewed staff, conducted testing and recorded findings in work papers. Upon completion of fieldwork, I have assisted in composing reports for senior management to identify shortcomings, commend strengths and propose Outside of engagements, I have added value to the company. I successfully recruited a skilled professional, conducted interviews for internship positions and actively participated in graduate recruitment events. In addition, I coordinated the operations for the annual EY charity event, which raised over $7000 to help children with disabilities. Aizer Building Solutions Nov\u201911 \u2013 Dec \u201812 As a database manager at Aizer, I developed a QuickBase platform that was chosen by senior management. This required me to interview staff, review company policy and compose a functional specification with which to develop the database. I then used my database development skills to create the QuickBase platform which allowed staff to register new jobs and clients, monitor the status and resourcing of jobs and record communications with clients. An additional project I undertook was to utilise the QuickBase and Google Maps APIs to create a dynamic map displaying the location of all active sites. This assisted management to determine areas where the company had a strong presence and identify growth opportunity areas. I was also responsible for maintaining the company IT infrastructure, such as provisioning users, securing the network and installing patches and upgrades. researched available products based on price and functionality, composed a report outlining the preferred service to management, and used my web development skills to implement the chosen service. The project was very successful, resulting in the company gaining two new clients. Another engagement I worked on was the development of a billing portal that allowed customers of Talkup Communications to view their bills as well as analyse their historical usage trends. I developed the project plan, scheduling tasks, identifying required resources and defining milestones. I then used my web developments skills (including PHP, HTML, JavaScript and Joomla) to create the billing portal on the company&aposs website. After reviewing and testing the portal, I presented my work to senior management, guiding them through the functionalities and responding to support requests. Sia ",

The research work designed and developed a frame work for autonomous bidding in multiple English auctions simultaneously. Intelligent Cognitive agents were cloned to participate in multiple auctions with financial and time constraints along with maintaining the preferences of the clients. The frame work was compared with Nicholas Jennings work and showed better accuracy in bidding autonomously. \u2022 Research Methods Used: Mathematical modelling using set theory, Conceptual Simulation \u2022 Supervisor: Professor Sunil S.

In this work the mobile agents migrated with data and computational code to the nearest processor in the network that was lightly loaded to carry out the task. The considered task was sorting a million numbers in distributed and parallel fashion using merge sort technique. The results obtained depicted that task distribution took more time than the actual sorting. Hence it was concluded that software agents may be used in intelligent applications such as bidding in auctions than in procedural tasks like sorting numbers. \u2022 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, \u2022 Karnataka University, Dharwad, Karnataka, India. \u2022 Undergraduate Project: Developed a Database Management System for Farming \u25aa Provide support to Slow learners and technical help to non-cognate students.

Teach operations staff on how to clean fibers and connectors with a Celtop cleaner. Document all the information on a Twiki database page. I also set up a test lab with 4948 switch for fault finding - attending sites, and isolating which end of the fiber would be running errors. \u25aa Set up a testing routine for network equipment that rarely failed. These routines gave the overnight shift technicians responsibilities, and familiarity with rarely used network management platforms. It also benchmarked the status of the equipment on a regular basis. One example is the Cisco ONS1544 DWDM \u2013 the dual 320gig dark fiber link between the datacenters. \u25aa Document the expected routes seen between BGP peers within the LAN/WAN/MAN zones interfacing various products like Netbank, TSIP, Comsee to the Bank\u2019s IP Network. This information was crucial in pinpointing what changes in the network could have caused traffic to fail to propagate through the network. \u25aa Benchmark the private CBD Man network supplied by multiple vendors to the Bank. Create a procedure to ensure redundancy was place, and traffic was load balanced across redundant links. Troubleshoot tcpip FTP sessions swallowing up the bandwidth, track down and shut down the rouge ports generating the traffic. The same issue on the WAN was controlled by having the correct router QOS policy settings. \u25aa Cisco Certifications in Voice (QoS) and Data networks attaining a Cisco Gold Partnership. I came to act as the bridge between the IP Voice, Data and legacy PABX teams in my organization. \u25aa Maintain an operations test lab with emergency spare equipment for each Cisco platform. Urgent high severity incidents always had spare parts available, far quicker than the vendor could source it from the warehouse. The Vendor RMA parts were loaded with the correct IOS, and then tested for 24 hours to ensure it would not fail. \u25aa Liaising with project stakeholders, change management and vendors to deliver outputs that satisfied all constraints whilst meeting our SLA\u2019s. I had major ATM SLA issues with the Netcomm smart56 modem (and its lack of spark suppressors). I worked with Netcomm, DiData & AWA to replace every Smart56 in the network (Approx 1000) with an industrial grade (IG6000) modem. \u25aa Facilitating training labs for employees (and vendor technicians) on many technologies. This gave them hands on experience. Using the device physically gave them a far greater understanding when fixing one remotely. The Triple Des Thales Datacryptor lab also gave me the ability to test software upgrades and isolate, and remove faulty encryptor units from the network. \u25aa I organized Team Building exercises like Team (and inter sectional) Breakfasts, get-togethers and bike rides. \u25aa Built a great rapport with fellow team players and gained respect as a mentor and life coach.

As is the way at a startup I got a chance to do a bit of everything and learned a lot, but I was primarily responsible for the Slingshot mini game, the Collection scene and the Screenshot Sandbox. Internship (3 months) - BlackDelta\ue063 PC https://store.steampowered.com/app/406350/KartKraft/ I had the exciting opportunity to get some hands on development experience in the early days of BlackDelta, working on their flagship title KartKraft out of their new offices. It was a hectic three months as the developers were in a rush to get the point cloud data of a track they had scanned and a realistic representation of the surrounds of the track, from photo reference they had taken, into the Unreal Engine, so a playable version could be shown at Gamescom. I assisted in the creation of trackside assets, and Cascade particle systems. \u201cHoloball\u201d - Microsoft/RMIT\ue063 I was lucky enough to get on the team with 2 other interns working directly under Prof. Zambetta tasked with creating a \u201cproof of concept\u201d prototype for Microsoft to be deployed on the Hololens. I got hands on experience with the Hololens which is a remarkable piece of technology, and the delivery of the final product was well received by Microsoft when Prof. Zambetta demoed it in Redmond. A reduced functionality version of that project is now the base environment in which a new MR class, which commenced last semester and will now be a core subject for all students in the Games and Graphics Programming stream, is based. HATL - RMIT (R&D)\ue063 For an intense 3 week period when Professor Sebastian Rodriguez, creator of the SARL language, was in the country, I got an amazing opportunity to work directly under him with one other intern, in assisting him to create a \u201cproof of concept\u201d set of scenarios using a new technology to be developed by RMIT for Defence Science and Technology Group; HATL (Human Agent Team Language). This project involved creating a \u201cproof of concept\u201d multi-agent holonic system (with SARL) to complete objectives using a custom version of StarCraft Brood War, and allowing a human to override and control agents while they completed objectives. The paper on this project has since been presented at an A Star level conference. MyCity Istanbul - VRTOV\ue063 https://www.facebook.com/mycityistanbul/ The owner and producer worked with children of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds whilst in Istanbul where the kids went out with cameras to take photos of the city currently, and then draw pictures of what they want the future of their city to look like. They also captured audio and 3D scans of the kids and put together an immersive composition merging the current city with their ",

I have been working in the Path Planning division, creating algorithms to detect and allocate paths for the vehicle. This involves C++, Linux and Python skills. This experience has taught me to problem solve in a way that has not been presented in a classroom; researching and taking on challenges that have not been pre-planned is a completely different and refreshing experience. Summer Store Host, Mecca Brands, Mecca Maxima, Chadstone, Melbourne, VIC \u2014 2018-2019 In this Christmas Casual role, I explored various roles in one of the biggest Mecca Maxima stores, whether that be working POS machines, delivering quality advice and service to customers or greeting every customer as hospitably as the store&aposs concierge, I have learnt so much about providing the best quality customer service possible, all while keeping the store and brand&aposs wellbeing in mind. I have met extraordinary role models in this job that have shown by example how to deliver only the best quality service in retail. Retail Customer Service, Breadlicious, Box Hill, Melbourne, VIC \u2014 2018-2018 In this job, I learnt to use a POS machine as well as maintain a bakery while delivering the best possible customer service. This casual job has taught me various aspects of retail work, skills that I had not encountered in previous jobs. Wait Staff, Mr Hendricks, Balwyn, Melbourne, VIC \u2014 2018-Present This is a casual wait staff job in a highly rated cafe. This job allows me to experience hospitality work, especially in customer service. Other than simply serving customers, the job includes maintaining several parts of the cafe as odd jobs, allowing me to learn various parts in running a cafe as well as simple customer service. I picked up this job on top of my swim teaching job as I wanted to try something new and experience the hospitality industry as I believe the hospitality has more room for growth and improvement. 0432510353 natalie.zw.lin@gmail.com Canterbury 3126 NATALIE LIN Teacher of Swimming and Water Safety, Kew Recreational Centre, Kew, Melbourne, VIC \u2014 2016-Present This casual job requires a deep understanding of Swimming and Water Safety, so that lessons can be greatly educational. Simultaneously, lessons must be engaging and attend to individual students&apos requirements as best as possible. Whilst appealing to young children, this job also requires frequent interaction with parents as well as coworkers in planning lessons and any curriculum changes. ",

This has allowed me to get to know different children and \ufb01nd different methods to work with different personalities, whether the child is friendly and energetic or overreactive and afraid of water.
